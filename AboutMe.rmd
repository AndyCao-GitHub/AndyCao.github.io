As this page is most likely to be shown in the CDS "Cookies and R" session, I've prepared beforehand and replaced the picture of myself. Hopefully this picture of a cinnamon roll will do.

I am a MSc student enrolled in psychology at the University of Basel, with a passion for statistics and datascience in general. Generally having a high amount of openness towards many kinds of topics, I like to explore on my own pace. Though I am also an unmovable object on topics which I dread. Luckily, the list is limited to a small amount.

But as a psychologist, I know one should not take self-reports at face value... So I let the [~~chess~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxe0o2pCGwo&ab_channel=DavidMays) quote speak for itself:

 > "There are 3 inevitable things in life: change, death, and Andy trying every opportunity possible to get involved with R and statistics"
