**Disclaimer:**   

Before you dive into my humble webpage, I want to make one thing clear: please do not take the work here too seriously!  

This website is my playground - a place where I experiment with code (and often break it!), share my subjective opinions on personal projects, and document my coding adventures during my time at the University of Basel.  

So, buckle up and get ready to embark on a journey filled with silly ideas, playful experiments and pure chaos.  

Warm regards,  
Andy
