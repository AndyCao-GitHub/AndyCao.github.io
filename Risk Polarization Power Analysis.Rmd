# Power Analysis

## Introduction

This work builds on my [first (and failed) attempt](Risk-Polarization-Simulation.html) to estimate how many ratings one needs to sample to have a reliable measure of a certain population. Therefore, readers are advised to catch up on my previous work to be up to speed on this smaller project.  

As the unconventional approach did not work, we will revert back to the more "old school" methodologies of a a priori power analysis. That is, estimating the minimum sample size needed to uncover a set effect size (or bigger), given a significance level and type II (false negatives) error.  

## Method

Given the novel nature of our upcoming study, these assumptions were made accordingly:  

- As we have no real consensus what polarization entails, getting a numerical quantifier for the effect size seems to be 






We will work with the same sampled matrix again

```{r}
population <- 10^5
prop_minority <- .02

# Create a grid of parameters
beta_param <- data.frame( param_1 = c( 2, .1),
            param_2 = c(.6, .1))
# set the seed, so everything here is replicable
set.seed(42)

# Generate random data from beta distributions with different parameters
data <- map2(beta_param$param_1, beta_param$param_2, ~ rbeta(population, .x, .y))

df <- as.data.frame(data)
```
